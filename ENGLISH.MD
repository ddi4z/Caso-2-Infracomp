# Case-2-Infracomp

## Description

This repository contains the code related to Case 2 of Infracomp.

The first part of the case involves simulating the generation of references for a specific algorithm. This algorithm changes all the cells of an m*n matrix based on a 3x3 filter and outputs the result in a new matrix. The program simulates the generation of a reference both when writing to and reading from the cells of each matrix. Finally, the program returns a list of all the generated references, as well as other relevant data.

The second part of the case uses the references generated in the first part to determine the number of faults and hits that would occur with an initial configuration given through the console, all using the NRU replacement algorithm.
